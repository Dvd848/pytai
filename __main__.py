"""A basic Visualizer and HEX Viewer GUI in Python, based on Kaitai Struct parsing.

This program offers a basic user interface to analyze the internal structure of 
binary files for a number of predefined formats. 
It utilizes the Kaitai Struct project to allow the user to navigate through 
a given binary file and match its logical contents to the matching binary
representation as displayed in the HEX view.
